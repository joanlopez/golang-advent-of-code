## 2020 Problems

### Day 1: Report Repair

It can be solved just by nesting loops, so basically checking the equality condition for each pair (or triplet) of
numbers. Of course, multiple optimizations can be applied, for example, by sorting the numbers in order to reduce
the total amount of pairs or triplets to check. However, there is no optimization really required to get the answer for
the given input in a reasonable time.

### Day 2: Password Philosophy

Extremely easy. Just a few of string manipulations and index accesses are required to solve it.
