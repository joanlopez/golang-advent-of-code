## 2022 Problems

### Day 1: Calorie Counting

You need to accumulate the sum for every (N=3) lines, until next empty line, and keep a global maximum, which value is 
the response for the first part. Then, for the second part you just need to keep up to three global maximum values.

### Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

You need to build a conversion _map_ between opponent moves and the expected result and translate them to corresponding
score by following the conversion rules also defined in the statement. **Tip:** Use numeric "enums" to make score
calculations sugary. Then, for the second part you just need to adjust the conversion _map_.
